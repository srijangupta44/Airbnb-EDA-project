## ðŸ“–	Steps Involved

### Data Cleaning
Our data set contains a large number of null values in the  last_reviewreviews_per_month column, so we drop them. Some of the columns have a smaller number of null values, so we replace the null values in these columns with the mode value of that particular column. Our data set also contain the duplicate rows for a single application. We also drop the duplicate rows because the rows contain the identical data.

### Data Transforming 
From the information of data frame, we can see that all the columns except latitude and longitude have the object data type but some of the columns like, reviews, reviews per month, availibility 365, price have the numerical value. So, we have to transform them in proper data type and also remove the unwanted values from the numerical columns. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
After establishing a good sense of each feature, we proceeded with plotting a pairwise plot between all the quantitative variables to look for any evident patterns or relationships between the features. 

### Single Variate Analysis
After that we analysis all the columns one by one to examine whether the particular column contain some useful information or not:

### Category
We breakdown the airbnb data by category and observe that Entire home/apt at Manhattan place have higher booking and vising of visitors. 

### Data wrangling
Apart from this, one new columns were added to the main data frame, "year". This is done to improve simplify the analysis and come up with different meaningful visualizations
By doing these operations on the original dataset, we are ready with the data pipeline, and data visualizations can be done on it.
